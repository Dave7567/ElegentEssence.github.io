        <h1>MISSION</h1>
        <p> 
            The story of Elegant essence is founded on audacity. Since its creation in Lusaka by Darshit Dave in 2003, Elegant essence has evolved through welcoming visionaries and free spirits into the company. Today this pioneering spirit is more alive than ever.  
            Pushing the boundaries, changing the use or meaning to reveal beauty, setting off on an adventure to distant horizons and embracing the rich diversity of other cultures, this creative energy is fundamental to everything, every day.
